# Diablo 1 Trainer

![The trainer in action](https://github.com/danjaaron/Diablo1-Trainer/blob/master/diablo-proof.PNG)

This repository contains the source code for a cheat trainer for Diablo 1 (GOG).

Pressing the "Life" button will max out your HP at 666, as shown in the picture. Any time your HP changes, it will be restored to 666 so long as the button remains pressed.

Same goes for the "Mana" button.

Enjoy!
